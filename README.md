# How to complete pending (or system error) sessions 
Use the following link.

YOUR_APP_URL/pendingcomplete?shop=SHOPIFY_SHOP_DOMAIN&id=PAYMENT_ID&kind=(sale|authorization)&action=(resolve|reject)&code=(PROCESSING_ERROR|RISKY|AUTHENTICATION_REJECTED|...)&error=ERROR_MESSAGE_FOR_REJECT

# TIPS
If you input 500 or 400 or 404 or 405 to customer's first name (given_name) in the shipping address, the app responses that HTTP error status to Shopify's session request body which prevents all following steps. 

If you input 'delay-XXX (XXX = nummeric like 10)' to customer's last name (family_name) in the shipping address, the app delay the response in that seconds to Shopify's session request body which produces an error or warning.
